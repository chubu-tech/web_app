# Tho — the web app

The Bhutan Salons product in a browser: customers book chairs and join walk-in
queues, owners run their salon, staff see their day. Next.js 16 (App Router),
React 19, Tailwind 4, TypeScript.

**Status: Phase 2a (browse).** Discover, the salon page and Saved are live against
the real database, at all four breakpoints, for a visitor with no session. Next:
2b booking → 2c the walk-in queue (`/q/<id>` as the QR target) → 2d products,
loyalty, chat, notifications, profile, map. Then owner, then staff.

## This repo owns no data

The database is the **`bsalons` Supabase project**, shared with:

| Repo | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `chubu-tech/tho` (`../tho`) | The Flutter app + **all** migrations. **The source of truth for product behaviour, tokens and copy.** |
| `chubu-tech/admin_dashboard` (`../admin`) | The internal operator console. Not part of this app; `admin` users are sent there. |
| `../landing_page` | The public marketing site. Different design language on purpose — see below. |

**Never write SQL here.** Schema changes belong in `../tho/supabase/migrations/`.
Nothing in Phase 1 needed any: all 40 non-admin `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs are
already granted to `authenticated`.

## Non-negotiables

- **Every write goes through an RPC.** `create_booking`, `cancel_booking`,
  `join_queue`, `place_order` and the rest authorise the caller themselves. Do
  not `.insert()`/`.update()` a table the app doesn't already write directly
  (favourites, follows, attachments).
- **The client is never the authority.** Guest limits, plan gating and role checks
  are all enforced server-side. `lib/booking-guards.ts` exists only to turn a
  rejection someone would have hit anyway into a sentence they see first — never
  treat a pass there as permission.
- **No service-role key, ever.** This app acts only as its signed-in user. That
  is the entire security model.
- **`../tho` is upstream.** Mirror it; never the reverse. When behaviour here
  disagrees with the Flutter app, the Flutter app is right.

## The account model

Three states, in `lib/auth.ts`:

- **anonymous** — no session. Reads everything RLS allows `anon`: approved
  salons, services, hours, reviews. This is what a visitor from a search result
  or a QR scan gets, and it must keep working.
- **guest** — a real *anonymous* Supabase session. Same reads, plus favourites
  and follows persist. The server refuses anything that commits them.
- **registered** — everything unlocked.

Upgrading a guest keeps the **same user id**, which is why their saved salons
survive sign-up. That is why anonymous sessions were chosen over public anon-key
reads.

**Create the guest session lazily.** `signInAnonymously()` mints a real
`auth.users` row; doing it on arrival or in `proxy.ts` would create one per
crawler hit. Call `ensureGuestSession` from the first action that needs an
identity. The Flutter app can be eager because an install is a person — the open
web is not the same problem.

Role comes from `profiles.role`, resolved **server-side** in `lib/session.ts`.
Not from a JWT claim, and not in a client component — the app had to work around
token refreshes re-firing a client-side role fetch (`auth_gate.dart:37-45`); on
the server there is no refresh to race.

Guest restrictions surface as a **dialog at the point of action**, never a
redirect. Losing someone's place mid-booking to a login page is worse than
asking in situ.

## Time

**One fixed zone: `Asia/Thimphu`, UTC+6, no DST.** `lib/time.ts` mirrors the
constant the Flutter app hardcodes and the `at time zone` comparison the RPCs do.

**Do not add a timezone library.** It would introduce DST handling the database
does not have. Matching the backend exactly matters more than generality the
product will never use.

## Design

`app/globals.css` is a one-to-one port of `../tho/app/lib/ui/tokens.dart`. Add a
token there rather than hardcoding a hex, radius or duration in a component.

Two rules that are decisions, not styling:

1. **`--color-rausch-cta` (#E00B41) for filled buttons with white text.** White on
   `--color-rausch` (#FF385C) is 3.53:1 and fails WCAG AA; the deeper hue is
   4.89:1. Using rausch for a filled CTA reintroduces a bug that was already
   fixed once.
2. **One shadow tier** (`shadow-card`). A surface has it or nothing — there are no
   progressive elevation tiers.

Stars are **always** `--color-star`, ratings only. Light mode only; there is no
dark mode in DESIGN.md and the canvas is always pure white.

**Do not borrow from `../landing_page`.** Its cream canvas and editorial type are
a deliberate marketing-only layer that the product does not use.

**Desktop is new design work**, not a port. The Flutter screens are phone-only.
`../tho/DESIGN.md:518-537` gives the breakpoints (`tablet` 744 / `desktop` 1128 /
`wide` 1440) and the rule: *always reduce columns, never reflow rows*.

## Ported logic

`lib/time.ts`, `lib/calendar-logic.ts`, `lib/booking-guards.ts`,
`lib/discover-logic.ts`, `lib/recommendations.ts`, `lib/salon-filters.ts` and
`lib/whatsapp.ts` are ports of the Dart originals, and their tests are ports of
`../tho/app/test/*_test.dart` with the same cases and expectations. **Keep them in
step**: if either platform changes a rule, both suites should change together. A
silent off-by-one in Thimphu day bounds would corrupt every calendar view.

Two places diverge from the Dart **on purpose**, both commented at the call site:

1. **Availability and opening hours are judged in Thimphu time**, not the device's
   (`recommendations.ts`, `salon-copy.ts`). The app reads `DateTime.now()` locally,
   which is sound on a phone in Bhutan and wrong in a browser that can be anywhere.
2. **A service with no recorded `gender` counts as "might suit"** (`api/discovery.ts`).
   SQL `IN` never matches NULL, and 24 of 31 live services have no gender — filtering
   strictly dropped 8 of the 10 salons that have any services at all.

## The UI kit

`components/ui/` are ports of `../tho/app/lib/ui/widgets/` and
`customer/detail_sections.dart`. Reuse them; don't restyle a one-off.

- **Icons come from `components/ui/icons.ts`, never `lucide-react` directly.** One
  name per concept, mirroring `../tho/app/lib/ui/icons.dart` — that indirection is
  the whole point, and it's what stops `haircut` becoming three spellings.
- Sizes come from `IconSize`, chosen by the **role** a glyph plays. `md` is the
  default.
- **The type scale needs no new tokens.** `theme.dart`'s `titleMd`/`titleSm`/
  `buttonMd`/`buttonSm` differ from what's in `globals.css` only by *weight*:
  `text-title font-semibold` / `text-title font-medium` / `text-title font-medium` /
  `text-caption font-medium`. The rausch 10% tints are `bg-rausch/10`.
- `Sheet` is **not** a port: it adds Escape, a focus trap, focus restoration,
  `role="dialog"` and a scroll lock. The app's sheets and the admin console's mobile
  nav lack all of that. Build every modal on it rather than starting over.
- `SelectTile` wraps a real `<input type="radio">`, and `Chip`/`SegmentedControl`
  carry `aria-pressed`/`role="tab"`. Keep new controls real elements.
- `CoverImage` and `Avatar` fall back to a seeded gradient monogram on error. That
  is both the port of Flutter's `errorBuilder` **and** the safety net for an image
  host missing from `next.config.ts`'s `remotePatterns`.

## The nav shows only what exists

`components/customer/destinations.ts` holds all five tabs and the drawer items with
a `ready` flag. A destination appears only when its route does, so no tab ever leads
somewhere unfinished — flip the flag in the milestone that lands the route. Same rule
for links inside pages: `SpecialistCard` takes an optional `href` for exactly this
reason.

## Live data is messier than it looks

Check assumptions against it before trusting a column:

- **`businesses.city` contradicts `address_text` on 8 of 13 live salons**
  ("Norzin Lam, Thimphu" filed under Paro). `addressText` is the field owners
  actually maintain; the mapper deliberately omits `city`.
- 24 of 31 services have no `gender`; 4 salons have no cover; 1 has a gallery;
  0 have offers; 0 are `home_based`/`mobile`, so the coverage-line branch has no
  live example and is covered by unit tests instead.
- Two rows named `Test 01`/`Test 2` are live and approved, so they appear in the
  catalogue. That's a data cleanup in the admin console, not something to filter out
  here.

## Verify

```bash
npm run dev
npm run build     # also typechecks
npm run lint
npm run test      # ported pure logic
```

A clean build, lint and test run is the bar. Note `overrides.typescript-eslint`
in `package.json` pins 8.65.0: upstream published a version depending on
`@typescript-eslint/utils@8.66.0`, which does not exist. Remove the pin once that
is consistent again.
